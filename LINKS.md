* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) â€” Visual Studio Code is a free code editor, released for Windows, macOS and Linux, and probably does everything that Visual Studio 2007 Express Edition did and more. In any case, there _is_ still the possibility of getting the Community Edition of Visual Studio (Windows and Mac only), which is free but nevertheless includes most tools mentioned in the [README](README.md)
